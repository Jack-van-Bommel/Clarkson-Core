= 0.2.0 - June 7, 2017 =

This release breaks backwards compatibility, but we got your back by just adding 1 line. [More info](http://wp-clarkson.com/core/docs/upgrading.html)

<?php
// Paste this code in mu-plugins/clarkson-core-deprecated.php
add_filter('clarkson_core_autoload_theme_pre_020', '__return_true');

* Proper autoloading of wordpress-objects
* Autoloading Core and Theme `wordpress-objects`.
* Removal of loading theme specific directory via `glob`.
* Autoload CPT's when the filename is seperated by minus instead of underscore

If you used these then your code wouldn't have worked, so we removed them:
* Replace / remove hma_get_user_url & hma_get_avatar
* Remove get_avatar_img code that uses hma_get_avatar

Non breaking
* Remove `symfony/translations` dependency.
* Commit `composer.lock` file.
* Fix page_vars - Add `user` to context and move vars into one place
* Term object not correctly getting loaded
* "get_json" method missing on Clarkson_Object
* Replace hm_is_queried_object
